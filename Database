### 🗄️ Centralized Data Storage

We use **MySQL** as the primary database to store all structured data in this project. This relational database provides a reliable and efficient foundation for managing legal documents, metadata, and cross-linked information.

#### 🔧 Future Integration with Vector Database

To enable intelligent features such as:

- Semantic search and LLM-powered Q&A  
- Document similarity comparison  
- Context-aware recommendations  

we plan to **preprocess and convert selected data into embeddings**, which will be stored in a **vector database** (e.g., Qdrant, Pinecone, or Chroma).

#### System Architecture Benefits

This architecture design ensures:

-  Efficient use of system resources  
- Decoupling transactional operations from AI computation  
- High scalability for future AI modules  
- Modular design for seamless system upgrades  

By separating structured data (MySQL) from unstructured vector queries, we can support both traditional database operations and modern AI-powered reasoning efficiently.
